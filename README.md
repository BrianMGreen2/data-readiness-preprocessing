# Data Readiness & Preprocessing for AI

This repository offers a strategic and operational toolkit for improving data readiness in AI projects, particularly for unstructured data in healthcare, life sciences, and regulated sectors. It focuses on workflows, techniques, and evaluation criteria that make data usable, explainable, and governance-aligned for AI model development.

## ðŸ“Œ Purpose

To help teams:
- Diagnose gaps in data readiness across technical and governance domains
- Standardize and preprocess diverse datasets (e.g., free text, semi-structured inputs)
- Implement **dynamic chunking**, **context-aware segmentation**, and **labeling strategies** for downstream AI use
- Align data preprocessing with AI ethics, explainability, and auditability goals

## ðŸ“‚ What You'll Find Here

- `playbooks/` â€” End-to-end guides for preparing unstructured and semi-structured data
- `chunking/` â€” Examples of context-aware vs. static chunking strategies
- `workflows/` â€” Visualizations and pseudocode for preprocessing pipelines
- `checklists/` â€” Data quality, metadata, and governance readiness templates
- `references/` â€” Key papers, open-source tools, and framework comparisons

## ðŸ§  Topics Covered

- Context-aware and dynamic chunking for GenAI
- Privacy-preserving data preprocessing
- Aligning with FAIR, TRUST, and data minimization principles
- Standardization and traceability across pipelines
- Data transformation for health data, EHRs, and longitudinal datasets

## âœ… Ideal For

- AI and data science teams working in healthcare, biopharma, and public sector
- Clinical informaticians and health data engineers
- Governance and compliance teams ensuring responsible AI data practices
