# 🧩 Chunking Strategies for AI Readiness

This document provides an overview of chunking strategies used to prepare data, particularly **unstructured health data** like clinical notes, discharge summaries, and patient narratives, for use in generative AI and machine learning workflows.

## 🚀 Why Chunking Matters

AI systems, especially large language models (LLMs), require input within certain token limits. But effective chunking isn't just about fitting into size constraints—it’s about preserving **context**, **continuity**, and **semantic integrity**.

Improper chunking can lead to:
- Hallucinated or misleading model responses
- Loss of clinical nuance or timeline
- Incomplete understanding of patient history

## 🔄 Types of Chunking

### 1. 📏 **Static Chunking**
> Breaks data at arbitrary fixed intervals (e.g., every 500 words or tokens)

- ✅ Simple to implement
- ❌ Cuts through sentences or clinical concepts
- ❌ Risks loss of critical context

### 2. 🧠 **Context-Aware Chunking**
> Uses structure, intent, or meaning to guide segmentation

- ✅ Aligns with natural language boundaries (e.g., paragraphs, visit notes, sections like "Assessment" or "Plan")
- ✅ Improves model comprehension and explainability
- ✅ Critical for **retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)** and longitudinal modeling

## 🧪 Use Case Examples

| Use Case | Chunking Strategy | Why It Works |
|----------|-------------------|---------------|
| Discharge Summary | Context-aware via section headings | Preserves SOAP structure |
| Radiology Report | Sentence-level or finding-based | Keeps diagnostic statements intact |
| Longitudinal EHR Data | Time-stamped chunking | Maintains patient journey over time |

---

## 🔧 Tools & Techniques

- Rule-based chunking using regex and custom section parsers
- Sentence boundary detection (SpaCy, NLTK)
- Token-length balancing + contextual integrity checks
- Embedding similarity for boundary optimization

---

## 📌 Key Considerations

- Always test chunking strategies on real examples
- Use domain-specific cues (e.g., "Impression:" or "History of Present Illness")
- Document chunking logic for reproducibility and governance audits
